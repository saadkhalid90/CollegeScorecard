For the development of this project, I made use of:
- python 2.7
- Ipython notebook
- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Sklearn libraries in python

My work is reported in College Scorecard Report.pdf and all the implementation
code can be found in the commented Ipython notebook College Scorecard.ipynb
